# RPG Chronicles

Books containing all notes, history of characters, lore dumps that can already be nicely described and all other stuff, that We would all like to gather and have a memory of after collaboratively creating this world and story.
We use Krozark's template which prooved very nice to use and really neat to look at.
We hope the developers would also enjoy the fact that their work is also appreciated and used by others to enhance their simple notes. :-)
